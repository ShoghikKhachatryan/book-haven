# User Account Management Module

This module focuses on the **User Account Management** functionality for the E-Commerce Platform. The primary features include:

- User registration
- Authentication
- Login
- Logout
- Password recovery

This module differentiates between two types of users: **Admin** and **Customer**.

## Features and Capabilities

### 1. Registration

#### 1.1 Admin Registration:

- **Admin** users are created by default using the `DataInitializer` class when the program is run.
- The `DataInitializer` class is used to add new admins.
- Current admin credentials:
   - Email address: `admin@example.com`
   - Password: `admin123`

#### 1.2 New User Registration:

- Users can register by providing an email and password.
- Upon successful registration, users are assigned the role of **Customer** by default.
- A verification email containing a unique token is sent to the user's email address for email verification.

   - If the user does not click on this link within 24 hours, the token will expire.
   - If the user confirms the token by clicking the link, they will be directed to the login page.
   - If a user attempts to register again with the same email address without confirming the token, the old token is invalidated, and a new token is generated and sent to the email address.

### 2. Login

- **Admin Login**:
   - Admin users are assigned by the DataInitializer class when the project is run. Admins are logged in with their assigned credentials.

- **User Login**:
   - Registered users can log in to their accounts using their credentials (email and password).

   - Both **Admin** and **Customer** roles have different landing pages post-login:
      - **Customer**: Redirected to dashboard.html.
        - My Profile
        - My Orders
        - Explore Books
      - **Admin**: Redirected to admin.html.
        - Manage Books 
        - View Orders
        - Manage Users
   - Login attempts are secured to prevent unauthorized access.

### 3. Logout

- **User Logout**:
   - "Admin"s and "Customer"s can securely log out of their accounts, terminating their current session and ensuring their information is protected.
   - Upon logout, the user is redirected to the login page.

### 4. Password Recovery

- **Password Recovery and Reset**:
   - Users can request a password reset link if they forget their password.
   - A unique token is generated and sent to the userâ€™s registered email address.
   - Users can use this token to securely set a new password.

### 5. User Authentication

- **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - The system verifies user credentials during login and ensures secure access to user-specific pages.
   - Only verified and authenticated users can access the dashboard pages.
   - Users who have not verified their email addresses can attempt to register again with the same email and receive a new verification token.
   - The module uses role-based access control to ensure that **Administrators** and **Customers** can only access their designated pages.

### 6. Password Management

- **Password Change**:
   - Users can change their passwords by using the "Forgot your password?" option on the login page.

## Usage

To use the User Account Management features:

1. **Registration**:
   - Go to the registration page and fill in the required information.
   - Check your email for the verification link and click it to activate your account.

2. **Login**:
   - Enter your registered email and password on the login page.
   - You will be redirected to the appropriate dashboard based on your role.

3. **Forgot Password**:
   - Click on the "Forgot Password" link on the login page.
   - Enter your email address to receive a password reset link.
   - Follow the instructions in the email to reset your password.

## Conclusion

This module provides a robust and secure user management system, enabling efficient registration, login, password management, and role-based access control. By distinguishing between **Administrator** and **Customer** roles, the system ensures that each user has the appropriate access and permissions.
